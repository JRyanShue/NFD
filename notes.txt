Notes for development

To run the OpenAI script from python, basically need to create a Namespace object in place of the args passed through argpase. 
Going to run the script normally and print out the args object, and replicate it in a Namespace.
Pushing everything to an NFD preview

I think sys.path is off?
Because when the module guided_diffusion is set up, sys.path automatically looks for it. 
Problem is in the "pip install -e ."
Ok, ran "pip uninstall guided-diffusion"
Also, have to change "guided_diffusion" imports to "neural_field_diffusion.guided_diffusion"

Now getting this error: "RuntimeError: Unable to find a valid cuDNN algorithm to run convolution"
So when I want to switch between neural-field-diffusion and nfd, I have to redo the "pip install -e ."
Not a big deal, just have to remember. 
Still getting the error. I think I've gotten it before.

So it's working now...weird.
On to splitting and decoding, then we're done!
Might want to also clean out the neural-field-diffusion codebase.

Ok, it works!
